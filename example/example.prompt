Please extract metadata from the provided document and return it in JSON format.
The fields I need are:
title,topic,sender,recipient,urgency(with value either n/a or low or medium or high),
date_received,category.
Analyze the document to find the values for these fields and format the response as a
JSON object. Use the most likely answer for each field.
The response should contain only JSON data where the key and values are all in simple string
format(no nested object) for direct parsing by another program. So now additional text or
explanation, no introtext, the answer should start and end with curly brackets
delimiting the json object
